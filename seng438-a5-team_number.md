# Introduction
In the previous assignments, we have learned how to properly test a system through exploratory, white-box, and black-box testing as well as how to test a web system's GUI. Our previous assignments mostly concerned automated unit testing but with this assignment our focus is shifted into reliability acceptance testing as we determine the quality of a system. Our group has been tasked with assessing a software's quality using both Reliability Growth Testing and a Reliability Demonstration Chart in order to analyse the system's Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and reliability through failure counts.

In order to perform these tasks we used C-SFRAT, a tool that can analyse and present input data in forms more readable to us. Using the [[INSERT DATA SET]] dataset and after formatting it so it is readable by and [[INSERT DATA PARAMETERS]] parameters, we can create a reliability model and make predictions for the future. Reliability Growth Testing is used to analyse trends in changing failure rates whereas the Reliability Demonstration Chart is used to efficiently check if a target failure rate is met or not. λ represents the real failure rate while λF represents the target failure rate.

Following will be an analysis of both reliability analysis tools and a discussion and comparison between the results.
